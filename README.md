# elastostatic
A quick and dirty FEM solver for linear elastic BVPs

Computes the equilibrium displacement field of an isotropic linear elastic solid by lattice gradient descent minimization of the canonical energy functional. Follows the virtual work scheme in C. Lanczos' 'The Variational Principles of Mechanics.'

Package is self contained, functions for field calculus operators are included.
